Welcome to UberMicro.

I created UberMicro for my App Academy capstone project. The inspiration for the site came from good reads, a site which recommends books to users. My project idea was a spin of of this basic functionality, utilizing video games instead of books.

On UberMicro, a user is also able to organize their games through custom lists, starting with default lists, "want-to-play" and "played". This allows UberMicro to build a set of recommendations for that user, based on their relationships to games. Users are able to see how other users enjoyed a game by looking at the comments and reviews left on a game's main page, as well as leave their own comments. Finally, when a user finishes playing a game and they set their game status to 'played', that user is able to rate that game which contributes to the game's over-all average rating.
